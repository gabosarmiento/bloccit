# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

Made with my mentor [Aaron](https://github.com/abrongersma) at this awesome one-to-one mentorship program called [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
